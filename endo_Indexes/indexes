The index files are bowtie builds from genome, non-coding RNA, and transcriptome fasta files available from ensembl. The files are too large to include and can be retrieved here:

Alternatively, the genomic, ncRNA, and cDNA species fasta files can be downloaded from ensembl and bowtie build can be used to build the indexes.

To complete the tutorial in the practice folder, either the elegans directory must be downloaded in this folder, are the indexes must be built in this folder.
