# endoSeqR
Package to identify endo-siRNAs from small RNA 

1) endo_Indexes sub-folder includes instructions on obtaining index files needed for alignment. The index file folders for each species (elegans, musculus, rerio, etc.) should be dragged here.
2) practice sub-folder includes a practice dataset, a pdf tutorial walking through the procedure (coming soon), and the expected output files.

Note that endo_MAP and clean_up in this folder are linux executables. Upon first use, it may be necessary to go this this directory and type the following code in command line:
chmod u+x endo_MAP
chmod u+x clean_up
